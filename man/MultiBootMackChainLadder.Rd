MultiBootMackChainLadder(
  triangles,
  B = 100,
  distNy = "normal",
  names = NULL,
  threshold = NA,
  stab = NA
)
}
\arguments{
\item{triangles}{A List of Triangles objects of the same size.}

\item{B}{The number of boostrap replicates}

\item{distNy}{The process distribution for next year increments. Either "normal" (default), "residuals.bycolumn","residuals.global" or "residuals". See details below.}

\item{names}{enventual names of the different triangles. IF set to NULL, the procedure will try to get names from the triangles list (first argument)}

\item{threshold}{Eventual exclusions limit for residuals. Set to NA (default) to avoid excluding anything.}

\item{stab}{Stabilisation parameter (number of CL coefs we keep). See the code.}
}
\value{
a MBMCL object containing a list of BMCL objects and a little more.
}
\description{
The multi boot mack chain ladder algorythm computes todays and next-year estimates on a portefolio of several triangles, following closely a synchronised version of BootMackChainLadder.
}
\details{
This function calculates, on a list of triangles, a synchronised bootstrap in the Mack model for the triangles.
The One-year point of view is also calculated.
It returns a specific S3 object, on wich you can use the standard functions like mean, CDR, NyIBNR, Corel provided by the package,
to produce usefull outputs. 

This model uses the fact that the Mack model can be seen as a quasi-glm, and therefore provide resiuals.
Bootstrapping thoose residuals on the upper-left triangle allows to get bootstrap distribution of today's estimations (reserves, ultimates, ...).
Furthermore, if you simulate net year payments with a given process ditribution in each simulation, it gives 1 year results.

The Multivariate dependence structure is induced by bootstrapping jointly the residueals of each triangles.

If distNy = "normal", it follows *Boumezoued & al: One-year reserve risk including a tail factor : closed formula and bootstrapp aproach, 2011* and converges to the Merz-Wuthrich formula in the Braun model.
If distNy = "residuals", it also converges strongly but NOT to the Merz-Wuthrich formula, although each triangles is bootstrapped according to the Mack model, and has volatility parameters that matches the Mack model.
Notes that if you choose distNy = "residuals.bycolumn", the residuals will be resampled inside each column and not accross columns. 
Setting distNy = "residuals.global" or "residuals" triggers the same code.
