\title{ Estimate age-to-age factors }
\description{
Basic chain ladder function to estimate age-to-age factors for a given
cumulative run-off triangle. This function is used by Mack- and MunichChainLadder.
}
\usage{
chainladder(Triangle, weights = 1, delta = 1)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
   \item{Triangle}{cumulative claims triangle.  A (mxn)-matrix \eqn{C_{ik}} 
    which is filled for \eqn{k \leq n+1-i; i=1,\ldots,m; m\geq n }, see
    \code{\link{qpaid}} for how to use (mxn)-development triangles with
    m<n, say higher development period frequency (e.g quarterly) than
    origin period frequency (e.g accident years).}
  \item{weights}{ weights. Default: 1, which sets the weights for all
    triangle entries to 1. Otherwise specify weights as a matrix of the same
    dimension as \code{Triangle} with all weight entries in [0; 1], where entry
    \eqn{W_{i,k}} corresponds to the point \eqn{C_{i,k+1}/C_{i,k}}.}
  \item{delta}{'weighting' parameters, either 0,1 or 2. Default: 1;
    delta=1 gives the historical chain
    ladder age-to-age factors, delta=2 gives the straight average of the
    observed individual development factors and delta=0 is the result of
    an ordinary regression of \eqn{C_{i,k+1}} against \eqn{C_{i,k}} with
    intercept 0, see Barnett & Zehnwirth (2000);.
    Please note that Mack (1999) used the notation of alphas, with alpha=2-delta.
  }
}

\details{
 
  The key idea is to see the chain ladder algorithm as a weighted linear regression
  through the origin applied to each development period.

  Suppose \code{y} is the vector of cumulative claims at development period
  \code{i+1}, and \code{x} at development period \code{i}, \code{w} are
  weighting factors and \code{F} the individual age-to-age factors \code{F=y/x}, than
  we get the various age-to-age factors for different deltas (alphas) as:

  \code{sum(w*x^alpha*F)/sum(w*x^alpha) # Mack (1999) notation}
  
  \code{delta <- 2-alpha}
  
  \code{lm(y~x + 0 ,weights=w/x^delta) # Barnett & Zehnwirth (2000) notation}
  
 }
\value{
  chainladder returns a list with the following elements:
  \item{Models}{linear regression models for each development period}
  \item{Triangle}{input triangle of cumulative claims}
  \item{weights}{weights used}
  \item{delta}{deltas used}
}
