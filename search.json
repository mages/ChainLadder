General Insurance (Non-Life Insurance, e.g. motor, property casualty insurance) policies run period 12 months. However, claims payment process can take years even decades. Therefore often even delivery date product known insurers. particular losses arising casualty insurance can take long time settle even claims acknowledged may take time establish extent claims settlement cost. Claims can take years materialize. complex costly example claims asbestos liabilities, particularly connection mesothelioma lung damage arising prolonged exposure asbestos. research report working party Institute Faculty Actuaries estimated un-discounted cost UK mesothelioma-related claims UK Insurance Market period 2009 2050 around £10bn, see (Gravelsons et al. 2009). cost asbestos related claims US worldwide insurance industry estimate around $120bn 2002, see (Michaels 2002).
