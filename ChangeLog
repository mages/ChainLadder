	* R/MackChainLadderFunctions.R: added function
	TotalMack.S.E function to estimate the overall standard error for
	the reserve. MackChainLadder gives now also the
	Total.Mack.S.E. back plus the estimate standard error for all
	individual age-to-age factors F.se.

         * R/MackChainLadder.R Bug fix: Function Mack.S.E did not give F.se back, 
           which is needed by TotalMack.S.E. 
           Many thanks to Florian Leitenstorfer for reporting this issue.
