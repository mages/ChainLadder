# Methods and Models for Claims Reserving

ChainLadder provides methods and models which are typically used in
insurance claims reserving.

The package grew out of presentations given at the Stochastic Reserving
Seminar at the Institute of Actuaries in 2007 and 2008 and followed by
talks at CAS meetings in 2008 and 2010.

More information is available on the project web site
