Description: The ChainLadder package provides various statistical
    methods which are typically used for the estimation of
    outstanding claims reserves in general insurance. The
    package has implementations of the Mack, Munich, Bootstrap, 
    multivariate, and chain-ladder factor models (CLFM), 
    as well as the loss development factor curve fitting
    methods of Dave Clark and generalised linear model
    based reserving models.
