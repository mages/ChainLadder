Description: The ChainLadder package provides various statistical
    methods which are typically used for the estimation of
    outstanding claims reserves in general insurance. The
    package has implementations of the Mack-, Munich-,
    Bootstrap, and multi-variate chain-ladder methods, as
    well as the loss development factor curve fitting
    methods of Dave Clark and generalised linear model
    based reserving models.
