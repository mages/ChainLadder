Description: Various statistical methods and models which are
    typically used for the estimation of outstanding claims reserves
    in general insurance. The package has implementations of the Mack-,
    Munich-, Bootstrap-, and multivariate-chain-ladder models,
    as well as generalised linear models and the loss-development-factor
    curve fitting methods of Dave Clark.
